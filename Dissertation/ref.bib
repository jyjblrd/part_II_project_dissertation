  abstract = {We present a novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. In total, we recorded 6 hours of traffic scenarios at 10–100 Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such as high-resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system. The scenarios are diverse, capturing real-world traffic situations, and range from freeways over rural areas to inner-city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks. This paper describes our recording platform, the data format and the utilities that we provide. }

  abstract = {This paper presents visual-inertial datasets collected on-board a micro aerial vehicle. The datasets contain synchronized stereo images, IMU measurements and accurate ground truth. The first batch of datasets facilitates the design and evaluation of visual-inertial localization algorithms on real flight data. It was collected in an industrial environment and contains millimeter accurate position ground truth from a laser tracking system. The second batch of datasets is aimed at precise 3D environment reconstruction and was recorded in a room equipped with a motion capture system. The datasets contain 6D pose ground truth and a detailed 3D scan of the environment. Eleven datasets are provided in total, ranging from slow flights under good visual conditions to dynamic flights with motion blur and poor illumination, enabling researchers to thoroughly test and evaluate their algorithms. All datasets contain raw sensor measurements, spatio-temporally aligned sensor data and ground truth, extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations and datasets for custom calibrations. }

  abstract = {Aerial robots are widely deployed, but highly cluttered environments such as dense forests remain inaccessible to drones and even more so to swarms of drones. In these scenarios, previously unknown surroundings and narrow corridors combined with requirements of swarm coordination can create challenges. To enable swarm navigation in the wild, we develop miniature but fully autonomous drones with a trajectory planner that can function in a timely and accurate manner based on limited information from onboard sensors. The planning problem satisfies various task requirements including flight efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, dynamical feasibility, swarm coordination, and so on, thus realizing an extensible planner. Furthermore, the proposed planner deforms trajectory shapes and adjusts time allocation synchronously based on spatial-temporal joint optimization. A high-quality trajectory thus can be obtained after exhaustively exploiting the solution space within only a few milliseconds, even in the most constrained environment. The planner is finally integrated into the developed palm-sized swarm platform with onboard perception, localization, and control. Benchmark comparisons validate the superior performance of the planner in trajectory quality and computing time. Various real-world field experiments demonstrate the extensibility of our system. Our approach evolves aerial robotics in three aspects: capability of cluttered environment navigation, extensibility to diverse task requirements, and coordination as a swarm without external facilities. A fully autonomous swarm composed of palm-sized drones with versatile task extensibility in the wild is realized.}

  abstract   = {In computational science and computer graphics, there is a strong requirement to represent and visualize information in the real domain, and many visualization data structures and algorithms have been proposed to achieve this aim. Unfortunately, the dataflow model that is often selected to address this issue in visualization systems is not flexible enough to visualize newly invented data structures and algorithms because this scheme can accept only specific data structures. To address this problem, we propose a new visualization tool, RViz, which is independent of the input information data structures. Since there is no requirement for additional efforts to manage the flow networks and the interface to abstracted information is simple in RViz, any scientific information visualization algorithms are easier to implement than the dataflow model. In this paper, we provide case studies in which we have successfully implemented new data structures and related algorithms using RViz, including geometry synthesis, distance field representation, and implicit surface reconstruction. Through these cases, we show how RViz helps users visualize and understand any hidden insights in input information.},
