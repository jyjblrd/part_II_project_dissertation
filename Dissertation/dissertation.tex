% Check the declaration of originality is up-to-date
I, Joshua Bird of Queens' College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer Science Tripos, hereby declare that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work, unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial extent for a comparable purpose. In preparation of this dissertation I did not use text from AI-assisted platforms generating natural language answers to user queries, including but not limited to ChatGPT. I am content for my dissertation to be made available to the students and staff of the University.

\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

This project aimed to develop a distributed visual simultaneous localization and mapping system that enables multiple agents to localize themselves within a collaboratively built map of the world using purely visual data. Additionally, agents should be able to act independently, failing gracefully if communication with their peers is lost. This would be followed by a quantitative evaluation of my system when run on industry-standard datasets.

\section*{Work Completed}

All success criteria have been met, with significant additional work being conducted. My system implements a novel approach to distributed visual simultaneous localization and mapping, outperforming comparable state-of-the-art systems on standard datasets. In addition, my system has been deployed on physical robots to demonstrate its real-world performance. Finally, considerable work has been put into developing generic infrastructure for my project including evaluation, simulation, and visualization tools, all of which have been made open-source alongside my core project. My work has been included in the paper \textit{The Cambridge RoboMaster: An Agile Multi-Robot Research Platform}, of which I am an author.
